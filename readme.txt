♦️ The Rating Game

🔶 Description
The Rating Game is a Mario Kart DS online tournament. Unlike most MKDS tournaments, the Rating Game offers Free-For-All (for 2, 3 and 4 players) and 2v2 matches, too.

The structure is quite-simple: each week some matches will be made between each player who gave their disponibility for their weekly match. Their opponent(s) will always end up being from a similar skill level, which is defined by the player's league. All the players who win their matches steal an amount of points from their opponent(s), and they will be ranked in a leaderboard based on their amount of points.

🔷 Full Rulebook

We highly recommend to read the Rulebook of the tournament. You can find it here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-5y9hzQqyEiQQg3OE-ojzfCV3QFHEByJ3WKSgKLeKXU/edit?usp=sharing

🔶 How to join

Hey guys, I've been working on an autosplitter for MKDS speedruns. Two for 32 tracks, one that split after you finish every single track and one that splits on the fadeout on every single cup. There's also a missions one that splits after every boss fadeout. 
Please read the README file for help with setup and to replace the reset.png to specific game if it's not English.
If there are any problems or you guys want me to add anything let me know and I'll update it
http://bit.ly/MKDSAutoSplitter 




Deleted User — 12/01/2023 09:04
To everyone, because this has been an occuring issue:
Try to submit your times only once or twice a week, so that you won't increase the work for our updaters
Thank you for taking this advice into your hearts 
Deleted User — 30/12/2022 20:28
To every future submission on this channel:
Please, we all encourage you to NEVER use discord emojis for your submission. These type of messages won't get verified by the bot, as it would break it. 
Example:
🙂=not allowed
:)=allowed
We appreciate your understanding :) 
Pikalex — 12/01/2021 04:43
In this channel you can send your submissions for the Players' Page (http://www.mariokart64.com/mkds/).

All you have to do is writing the exact same stuff you write in the Submission Thread, but in a Discord message to send here.

Example:
Date: January 12, 2021
Name: Alessandro Boi

Non-PRB:
MC: 1:32:754 / 0:30:041
rMC1: 0:41:843 / 0:13:040


Every message sent here doesn't get forwarded to the submission thread, but only the verified ones do.
To be verified, a message requires a ✅ reaction added by a moderator.
As such, don't worry too much about making mistakes: if you make a typo, a moderator will mention the mistake. We'll wait for you to fix it by editing or by sending a new message.
If the run got verified and forwarded, @Silver R.O.B. will send a confirmation message containing the actual content of what got posted.

Tips:
1️⃣ Double check every time what you wrote: it always requires Date, which can have many formats (January 12, 2021; Jan 12, 2021; 21 Jan 2021; etc.), your Players' Page name which has to be exactly correct, the category you're submitting to, the track abbreviation (all of them can be found here https://www.mariokart64.com/mkds/join.php).

2️⃣ You can add comments at the bottom of your post, like this:
Date: Jan 12, 2021
Name: Advaita Venkata

PRB:
RR: 0:36:097

Arre, how is this 37th lol

3️⃣ Editing your message or sending a new one both work.

4️⃣ Messages that aren't submission will be purged.

5️⃣ If you're new to the Players' Page, you still can start submitting here but your first message has to look like this:
Date: Date
Name: Name Surname or Nickname

Hi, I'm new! I'm from Town/Region, Country. My contact is my@email.lol.

Category:
Track: Time

Comment

Town/Region and comment are optional. What isn't is the Country. The e-mail isn't mandatory but it's recommended.

⚠️ Reminder! No emulators allowed! ⚠️

And that's it. Hope this will be helpful and nice to use! 
Pikalex — 12/01/2021 04:45
In case a submission with a mistake gets verified and successfully added:
That might happen. We'll fix it manually, so you don't have to worry too much about it, after all both you and the moderator made a mistake, lol.

3 star ranking guide

Your GP rank is decided by 2 scores, your Championship Point (CP) and your Hidden Point (HP).
Everybody should be familiar with CP. It's the point given to you based on where you placed in each race. HP is a score that is hidden from the player, and it's given base on how "well" you performed in the race. You start with 0 HP, and according to what you did, points are added or deducted from your HP.

ACTIONS THAT ADD HP:
Total Time for Each Race: Each circuit has a preset time. You will be awarded HP depending on how much faster your time is from the preset time.
Lead Time: HP is given for the time you've been in 1st place. The longer you are in 1st, the more HP you receive.
Rocket Boost/Start: +25 HP for each successful Rocket Boost.
Mini-Turbo: +2 HP for each successful mini-turbo.
Item Attack: +5 HP for each successful attack using item.

ACTIONS THAT DEDUCT HP:
Off-track Time: HP is deducted for the amount of time you spend off the track. The longer you are off-track, the more HP you loss. Exceptions are when you are under the effect of star, mushroom, bullet bill, or ghost(Boo).
Hit a Wall: -20 HP everytime you hit a wall.
Hit a Course Obstacle: -30 HP everytime you hit a course obstacle (car, fireball, etc.).
Fall off Track/ Picked up by Lakitu: -70 HP everytime you fall off track and get picked up by Lakitu.

iMathII — 13/04/2024 07:03 (Talking about the WP "ultra")
ill quickly write up everything i know currently about this shortcut for anyone interested in trying:

i haven't tested extensively, but polt has the most consistent timing window for the right press on the sc, you get ~11 frames within you can press (and hold) right and get the sc. i figure standard luigi will have a similar advantage here? haven't tested tho
aside from that, try to land on the ground and hit the wall at almost the same time, and you must hop frame perfect when you hit the ground
you must be angled as straight-forward as possible when you hit the ground, ideally start pressing right a little bit before the jump, how much before depends on your setup. in my run with my "setup", i started holding right 15 frames before the jump, so 1/4 of a second.
keep holding right until at least 2 frames after the jump, after that, start holding up to fast fall (not usually necessary, but it helps)
shroom timing is not important, as long as the shroom is active when you shroom (shrooming on the frame you hop will not work though, even 1 frame before is good but the same frame will fail)
hold down as early as possible after leaving the ramp, i forget how long exactly you need to hold it for but not very long, you can let go of it in the air pretty much whenever you like, but don't press up
also pressing A or B in the air or during the hop changes nothing
~~~~
for my setup specifically (you do not need to do this, but this is what helps me)
i put myself in the middle of the road before the ramp, where the road changes from green to grey. then i aim to the left where the solid grey road, grates, and zipper meet (a little to the left, if anything)

Japanese Exchange Battle: Special Rules:
If you want to play your JEB match in an unusual way, please give out to your opponents a specific signal when selecting a character: if your opponents return the signal you gave, that means they accepted your request of following the special rules. If they did not return it, then they rejected your request.

The signals are:
1. Spamming Mario: no restrictions on holding items between item boxes, deceleration is allowed and any course can be chosen (Unrestricted Match).
2. Spamming Bowser: no usage of items (NI or No Items Match).
3. Spamming Donkey Kong: no restrictions, apart from having to choose Donkey Kong and Rambi Rider (Rambi Match).
